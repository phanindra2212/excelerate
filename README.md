💰 Minimalist Budget Tracker
A fast, clutter-free mobile application built with Flutter for effortless personal finance logging and tracking.

🌟 Project Vision
The primary vision for this application is to solve the problem of complex, bloated finance apps. The Minimalist Budget Tracker is designed for the sole user who needs a quick, secure, and intuitive way to log daily income and expenses. Our goal is to promote daily financial awareness and health without unnecessary features or distractions.

🎯 Week 1 Objectives
This initial phase focuses on planning and setup to lay a solid foundation for development:

Project Setup: Initialize the Flutter project and configure the GitHub repository.

App Definition: Finalize the purpose, target users, and core feature set.

UI Planning: Create low-fidelity wireframes for the 4 core navigation screens (Login, Dashboard, Listing, Entry).

Documentation: Publish the initial project vision and scope in this README file.

✨ Core Features (Planned)
The application will include the following fundamental functionalities:

Secure Access: Simple PIN/Passcode login for security.

Real-time Dashboard: A clean Home screen displaying Total Income, Total Expenses, and the resulting Net Balance for the current period.

Quick Transaction Entry: A primary workflow for logging transactions with minimal taps.

Historical Listing: A detailed, scrollable list of all past financial entries, filterable by date and category.

Local Data Persistence: All data will be stored securely on the user's device (planned for Week 2).

🗺️ Navigation Flow (Learner Journey)
The primary user paths through the application are as follows:

Authentication: App Open → Login Screen (Enter PIN) → Dashboard

Tracking: Dashboard → FAB (+) → Transaction Entry Screen (Input Form) → Save → Dashboard

Review: Dashboard → History Button → Transaction Listing Screen (Scrollable List with Filters)

🛠️ Technical Stack (Initial)
Framework: Flutter (Dart)

Data Persistence (Planned): Hive or Shared Preferences (for local storage)
